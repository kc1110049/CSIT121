        Steamed or fried, the filled, flavorful delicacies are staple of Nepali
        cuisine with fast-growing following in the U.S and internationally.
        Nepali chicken momos are my favorite recipe because they are so easy to
        make and they just taste great. I love how the chicken momo always look
        so pretty when they're finished.
