    <h2>My Working and Coding Experience</h2>
    <p>I have had the opportunity to gain experience in the field of computer operations for two years prior in Standard Chartered Bank back in my country. Since enrolling at CCBC, I have developed a keen interest in coding and programming. I have taken several courses in programming languages such as Java, Python, and HTML, and have spent countless hours practicing and honing my skills in these languages. I am confident that my experience as a computer operator, coupled with my newly acquired coding skills, will make me a valuable asset in any role that requires technical expertise. I have been coding in and outside of class, from past internships to coding camps and even this course! Here's some of the languages/framework I know and where I learned them!</p>

    <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
    <p>I would like to take a moment to give a special shout-out to my amazing Professor Noone. Without her incredible teaching and support, I would not have been able to achieve my academic goals. She truly goes above and beyond for her students, and I am so grateful for all the time and effort she has put into helping me succeed. Thank you, Professor Noone, for being such an incredible teacher and mentor! Also, a massive thanks to W3Schools for forever expanding my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap!</p>
