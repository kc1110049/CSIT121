  Steamed or fried, the filled, flavorful delicacies are staple of Nepali cuisine with fast-growing following in the U.S and internationally. Nepali chicken momos are my favorite recipe because they are so easy to make and they just taste great. I love how the chicken momo always look so pretty when they're finished.</p>
